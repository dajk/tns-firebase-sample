Firebase is a backend service that pairs well with NativeScript on the client side for mobile apps.

1. Create an account and an app project in [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) and replace the URL of the Firebase app in [this branch's config file](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/blob/firebase/app/shared/config.js). Enable 'Email & Password' authentication and (optionally) add a user.

2. Fork this repo to your local computer and install the Firebase plugin by navigating to the root of the app and typing `npm install` in the command line.

3. You can start managing with app as soon as you can run your app on device or on a local simulator. Please refer to the [Firebase plugin documentation](http://plugins.telerik.com/nativescript/plugin/firebase) to learn more, and how you can enhance the app by leveraging more functions of this plugin.
